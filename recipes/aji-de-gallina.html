      <h2 class="second-title">Description</h2>
      <p>
        Ají de chicken is a Peruvian chicken stew. The dish is considered a
        popular Peruvian comfort food, and the name translates to "chicken
        chili" or "hen's chili" in English.[2] Ají de chicken is composed of a
        stir fry base made by sautéing red onion, garlic, and ají amarillo
        together, and adding shredded poached poultry and stock.

        The stew is then thickened with bread soaked in milk or evaporated milk,
        cheese such as parmesan, and ground nuts such as pecans or walnuts. Ají
        amarillo ("yellow chili") is a mildly spicy pepper native to South
        America, common in many Peruvian cuisine dishes. Ají de chicken is
        typically served with boiled potatoes and white rice, and garnished with
        black olives and hard-boiled egg.

      <h2 class="second-title">How to Make Aji de Chicken Step by Step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Place chicken breasts, onion, carrot, and 2 cloves garlic in a large
            saucepan, pour in 2 quarts of water and slowly bring to a simmer
            over medium-high heat. Skim off the foam which forms on top, then
            cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the chicken is
            tender, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to
            cool. Strain the resulting chicken stock, discarding the vegetables.

            Pour evaporated milk and 1/2 cup chicken stock into the bowl of a
            blender. Add bread cubes and puree until smooth. Add Parmesan cheese
            and walnuts; puree until smooth. Shred the cooled chicken and
            discard the bones.
          </p>
        </li>

          <p>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in
            minced garlic and minced onion; cook until the onion has softened
            and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in shredded chicken
            and aji amarillo until heated through. Pour in bread puree and cook
            until hot, stirring frequently. Add more chicken stock if needed to
            keep from getting too thick. Season with turmeric and simmer for 5
            minutes more.
          </p>
