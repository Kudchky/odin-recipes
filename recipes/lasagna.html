    <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>

    <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
